# 42PISCINE
This repository have the projects that I made at 42's Piscine. A 26-day (intensive) C bootcamp - from 03/March/2023 to 26/March/2023 in a presential 24/7 open campus.

## 42 Cursus
42 Cursus is a global education program with a innovative methodology based on the student view: without teachers, without schedule, without classrooms only mutual aid where students learn from their fellows (peer to peer). 42 program takes a project-based approach to progress, designed to develop technical and people skills that match the expectations of the labor market.

**The piscine is the first step of the program because is a part of the selection process, the other part of this is the frustration management and the adaptation hability and those comes from the student**

>The 42 cursus is a free presential program in a 24/7 open campus, for whoever is approved the piscine selection process.
42 have presence in 29 countries with 50 campuses

# C Piscine Skills

## Shell
The first days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal. 

## C language
The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

## Git
All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
be at ease with such a system.
