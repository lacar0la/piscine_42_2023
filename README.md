## 42 Cursus
42 Cursus is a global education program with a innovative methodology based on the student view: without teachers, without schedule, without classrooms only mutual aid where students learn from their fellows (peer to peer). 42 program takes a project-based approach to progress, designed to develop technical and people skills that match the expectations of the labor market.

**The piscine is the first step of the program because is a part of the selection process, the other part of this is the frustration management and the adaptation hability and those comes from the student**

>The 42 cursus is a free presential program in a 24/7 open campus, for whoever is approved the piscine selection process.
